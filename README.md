## Arduino Sketches
Just a random sampling of Arduino projects.

### ookdumper
Using the RFM69OOK library, attempt to decode an 433MHz OOK rain gauge
transmitter.  Expanded from the ookdumper sketch in the library.
Includes lots of debugging information to help narrow down RFM69
parameters such as bandwidth and threshold.

### rain_guaage_rfm69ook
Same logic as ookdumper, but customized for the AcuRite 00899 rain
gauge and my environment (Moteino).
